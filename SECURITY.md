## Security Considerations

Speak the Web is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **Local processing**: All text-to-speech happens on-device
- **No tracking**: No analytics or telemetry
- **No accounts**: No user data collection
- **Network requests**: Only user-initiated URL fetches and optional voice model downloads from GitHub

Thank you for helping keep Speak the Web secure.
