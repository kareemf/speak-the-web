App Store Review Notes - Speak the Web
======================================

DEMO INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
- No account required
- Sample article URL for testing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-speech
- To test HTTP confirmation flow: http://example.com (will prompt for confirmation)


ATS (APP TRANSPORT SECURITY) JUSTIFICATION
------------------------------------------
This app is a text-to-speech reader for web articles. Users provide URLs directly
(via paste or Share Extension). The app must support HTTP because:

1. Many older articles and archives are HTTP-only (legacy content, Internet Archive, etc.)
2. The app does not curate or suggest URLs — users control all content
3. No user data is transmitted; content flows one-way (fetch → local TTS)

Security mitigations implemented:
- HTTPS-first: All URLs upgraded to HTTPS; HTTP only allowed after explicit per-host user confirmation
- Comprehensive URL validation blocks dangerous schemes, private IPs, and localhost
- Redirect validation: Security checks re-applied after each redirect
- Visual indicator displayed for insecure connections

Content handling:
- The app does NOT use WKWebView to render fetched content
- HTML is parsed with a non-executing parser (no JavaScript evaluation)
- The app does NOT load remote resources (images, stylesheets, iframes, etc.)
- The app does NOT modify device network settings
- Content is text-only extraction for TTS playback


USER-GENERATED CONTENT NOTE
---------------------------
This app does NOT curate, index, recommend, or share content. The app has:
- NO content discovery features
- NO bookmarking with sync
- NO history sharing
- NO social features

Users provide URLs manually via paste or Share Extension — the app simply fetches
and reads aloud what the user explicitly requests.
