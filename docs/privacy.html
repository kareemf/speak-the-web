            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

            <p>Speak the Web ("we", "our", or "the app") is designed with your privacy in mind. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Short answer: Nothing.</strong></p>
            <p>Speak the Web processes everything locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any external servers.</p>

            <h2>Data Processed Locally</h2>
            <p>The following data is processed and stored only on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>URLs you enter:</strong> Stored locally in your recent articles list</li>
                <li><strong>Article content:</strong> Fetched from the web and cached locally for offline access</li>
                <li><strong>Reading progress:</strong> Saved locally so you can resume where you left off</li>
                <li><strong>Voice preferences:</strong> Your selected voice and speed settings</li>
                <li><strong>Downloaded voice models:</strong> Stored locally for offline text-to-speech</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Network Requests</h2>
            <p>The app makes network requests in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fetching articles:</strong> When you enter a URL, we request that webpage to extract the article content. The website you access may log your IP address and device information according to its own privacy practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Downloading voice models:</strong> When you choose to download a neural voice, the model is fetched from the <a href="https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx">k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx</a> repository on GitHub. GitHub's standard logging may record basic request metadata (IP address, timestamp) according to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These requests go directly to the source (the article's website or GitHub for voice models). We do not proxy these requests through our own servers.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Speak the Web does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share any data with third parties.</p>

            <h2>Voice Processing</h2>
            <p>All text-to-speech processing happens on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System voices (AVSpeech):</strong> Use Apple's on-device speech synthesis</li>
                <li><strong>Neural voices (Sherpa/Piper):</strong> Use locally-downloaded AI models that run entirely on your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your article content is never sent to any speech service or cloud API.</p>

            <h2>iCloud and Backups</h2>
            <p>Your app data may be included in iOS device backups (iCloud or local). This is handled by iOS and is subject to Apple's privacy practices.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>All data is stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearing your recent articles in the app</li>
                <li>Deleting downloaded voice models in Settings</li>
                <li>Deleting the app entirely</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Speak the Web does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app simply reads web content aloud and does not require any account or personal information to function.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
